# CCT-Program-Analysis
Using program-specific and generalized poverty data, this analysis (maintained in perpetuity at the [Columbia Academic Commons](https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/D80Z79FW)) uses time-series methods to show that while levels of poverty have decreased in countries implementing CCT programs, there is little evidence that CCT programs promise to be as effective in combating poverty in the long term as many would like to believe.
